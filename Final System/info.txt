This document outlines what the results produced mean:

Polarity: the number of positive tweets divided by the number of negative tweets (Higher indicates the film is being recieved well)
Subjectivity: the total number of positive and negative tweets divided by the number of neutral tweets 
(Higher indicates that people are sharing more opinions)

Critical Period: The critical period of a film is defined by the week before and the two weeks after a films release date
	week1 - week before films release
	week2 - week after the films has been released
	week3 - week after week 2


prediction: This is based on my primary reaserch into the topic area and this indicates based on the sentiment of the tweets how successful a film will be.
1. Very Good - from my research this is a value given to a film that achieved a domestic profit of $200mil or greater
2. Good - from my resaerch this is a value given to a film that achieved a domestic profirt less than $200mil but greater than $100mil
3. Okay - from my resaerch this is a value given to a film that achieved a domestic profirt of less than $100mil or breaks even
4. Bad - from my resaerch this is a value given to a film that achieved a domestic loss up to -$100mil
5. Very Bad - from my resaerch this is a value given to a film that achieved a domestic greater than -$100mil

Data mining - decision tree to determine prediction
Intial prediction with no chnage in polarity or subjectivity
Very Good - polarity > 4
Good - 4 >= polarity > 3.5
Okay - 3.5 >= polarity >= 2.0
Bad - 2.0 > polarity >= 1
Very Bad - 1.00 > polarity

If there is a change is polarity
Increase prediction by one level - polarity change > 2
Decrease prediction by one level - polarity chnage < -2

If there is a change in subjectivity
Increase prediction by one level - if subjectivity change > 2 and polarity increase by any amount
Decrease prediction by one level - if subjectivity change > 2 and polarity decreases by any amount
